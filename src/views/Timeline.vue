    <h5>Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Timeline.JS)</h5>
    <h5>The timeline works to document all of the research activities done by the members of the Initiative for Indigenous Futures, including artworks, workshops, symposia and press.<br><br>

Made from a custom / modified version of Northwestern University's knight lab <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">Timeline.js project.</a><br><br>

This interactive version built for Obx allows users to select custom views to see which research activities are in place over what time period. It also allows custom features for the lab itself, with presentation mode which allows the presenter of the timeline to leaf through the items using the arrow keys.
<br><br>Still in use in 2019, but has not been modified since 2016.</h5>
