    <h5>D/CART Labs is a web investigation into the the question “What is shared / borrowed in program spaces? (Why? How?)” In the Design and Computation Arts department (D/CART), students primarily share three labs: The Computation Lab, The Sensor Lab and the Visual Communication Lab. This project examined what was shared in five facets: first, the the shared physical space of the rooms, the knowledge sharing, the tools on loan, the resources available and finally the time restrictions on the rooms. Suggestions were listened to from both the staff and students of these spaces, and represented with time-based animations.
