    <h5>Melamina is a typeface inspired by melamine tablewear. Melamine is an organic compound with various applications, including dinnerware. It was a staple in many post-war kitchens, and is currently seeing a resurgence in popularity in many trendy homes.<br>

This typeface is defined by its occasional rounded corners, its relatively small x-height and its contrasting bold angled terminals. The typeface is most effective for titles and paired with serif body text, but may also be used for smaller blocks of text, such as subtitles or captions.</h5>
